# Project Description

We aim to create a focused and distraction-free web application tailored for curated YouTube content consumption.

## Key Features:

### 1. User Onboarding:
- Seamless onboarding experience for new users.

### 2. Content Search:
- Users can search for content either by **YouTube channel name** or by specific **topic keywords**.
- Search results will display relevant channels or content based on user queries.

### 3. Subscription Management:
- Users can subscribe to channels directly from the search results.

### 4. Curated Viewing:
- Once subscribed, the user will only have access to content from their subscribed channels.
- The application will present a distraction-free interface, allowing users to focus solely on their selected content.

## Objective:
Our goal is to create a YouTube-like platform where users can access and consume content in a highly personalized and distraction-free environment. By limiting their exposure to unnecessary or unrelated material, we enhance user focus and provide a streamlined experience.
